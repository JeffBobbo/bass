Very much still a work in progress, and probably has bugs (not to mention poor HTML/CSS/design). Issues and bugs can be reported in [issues](https://github.com/JeffBobbo/bass/issues).

## Using locally
Data is retrieved via `XMLHttpRequest`s, some (most? Chrome at least) browsers block `XMLHttpRequest`s over the `file://` protocol. Your browser might have an option to allow it, or otherwise can be solved by using a webserver locally.
